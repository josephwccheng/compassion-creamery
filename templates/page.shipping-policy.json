In other words, your order can be as big or small as you want for the same price. </p><p>For full transparency, we do not add any margin onto the shipping fee, and absorb as much of it as we can.</p><p>Please note we are a small operation so any reshipping will require an additional fee.</p><p><strong>HOW WILL MY PRODUCT BE SHIPPED?</strong></p><p>All products are shipped frozen. This does not affect the quality of the product. Shelf life of all products is 2-3 weeks and 3 months in freezer. Thaw before consumption</p><p><strong>WHEN WILL MY DELIVERY COME?</strong></p><p>Deliveries come between 8am-8pm. You will be sent a delivery time frame the evening before delivery. </p><p><strong>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO RECEIVE MY ORDER?</strong></p><p>All products in stock will be shipped and delivered within 1 week. Our stock does run out quickly though so it may take a few extra days. We make all of our delectable products in house so it really is a labour of love!
